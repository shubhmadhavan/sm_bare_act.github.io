    "summary": "Art 1(1) describes India as a 'Union of States', despite it being federal in structure. Dr BR Ambedkar justified this terminology by stating that the Indian Federation was was not the result of an agreemetnt among the States, and to emphasise that State did not have a right to secede.<br><br>Comparison with USA:<ul><li> The Federation of USA was a result of Articles of Confederation (1777), an agreement between the original 13 colonies.</li><li> Later, the Southern states waged a Civil War (1861-65) over the issue of states’ rights, particularly the right to secede from the Union. The war, resolved under the leadership of Abraham Lincoln, ultimately established that individual states have no constitutional right to secede.</li><li> This principle was later reinforced via SCOTUS' Texas v. White Case, 1869.</li></ul><br> Art 1(3) connotes that the term 'Territory of India' is wider than 'Union of India' as it also includes any 'acquired territories'.",
