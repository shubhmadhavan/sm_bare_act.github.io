    "text": "<p>Notwithstanding anything in Articles 5 and 6, a person who has after the first day of March, 1947, migrated from the territory of India to the territory now included in Pakistan shall not be deemed to be a citizen of India</p><p>Provided that nothing in this article shall apply to a person who, after having so migrated to the territory now included in Pakistan, has returned to the territory of India under a permit for resettlement or permanent return issued by or under the authority of any law and every such person shall for the purposes of clause (b) of article 6 be deemed to have migrated to the territory of India after the nineteenth day of July, 1948.</p>",
    "summary": "Partition also led to displacements & emigrations <i>from</i> India. While some left voluntarily,  others were forced to leave under extenuating circumstances. <br><br>Emigrants were generally deemed to have declared their allegiance to Pakistan and <i>denied</i> Indain citizenship, but <i>one exception</i> was still allowed: <ul> Those who returned under a permit by a competent authority would be treated as immigrants coming after 19th July, 1948 for Art 6(b).</ul> Art 7, therefore, does not grant citizenship rights to such returnees but simply makes permitted returnees eligible for citizenship if they registered, as req. u. Art 6(b).<br><br>March 1st, 1947 was chosen as the cutoff date as it was 'the date when the disturbances started and the exodus began' (Const Assembly Debates).",
