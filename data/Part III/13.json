        "description": "<br>In the <i>Shankari Prasad Case, 1951</i>, SC held that CAAs were not deemed 'law' u. Art 13 and Parl could amend any part of Const. This stance was reversed in the <i>Golaknath Case, 1967</i>, wherein SC held that CAAs are also 'laws' u. Art 13 & thus subject to the same limitations as other laws. <br><br>Thus, 24th CAA, 1971 inserted Art 13(4) to provide expressly that amending power of Parl extends to amending Part III. In effect, it means that Parl can amend any part of the Const.<br><br>However, in the <i>Kesavananda Bharati Case, 1973</i>, SC held that laws made after 24th April, 1973 must not violate the 'Basic Structure' of the Const. Memorably, J. HR Khanna emphasised that power to amend doesn't equate power to repeal."
